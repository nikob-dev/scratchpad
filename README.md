### Begin
The starting phrase for SQL transactions and a reminder that we're always starting something new. So make it count!

## Intro
This repo is a hodgepodge of different things. Mostly it contains code used in the course of my studies or from tackling practice problems.
This is where I try things out. Whether it's a solution to a leetcode problem or simple scripts where I'm trying new libraries, this is where I keep code that doesn't really stand on its own as an application or solution.

# Dev Journey

<br><ol><strong>Next:</strong> <li>TypeScript</li><li>Containers</li><li>node.js</li><li>Blockchain</li><li>Rust</li><li>Cybersecurity</li></ol>

# Leetcode
Working on this, little by little. Tackling the leetcode 75 first. I'll try my hand at the Pandas and SQL paths eventually.
